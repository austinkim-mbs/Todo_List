### About the app

I wrote a basic task tracker in React as a learning project. 
Each Task takes in a description and estimated completion time;
- Tasks are sorted based on time
- New Tasks can be added
- Tasks can be deleted
- Tasks marked completed will be moved to the bottom of the list. 



### Running the app

1. Ensure you have `npm` installed.


2. Install `http-server`

````
npm install
````

3. Boot the HTTP server

````
npm run server
````

The server is now running at [localhost:3000](localhost:3000)
